/**

 * @classdesc
 * Provides Services to register a user and create Endpoints (RtcommEndpoints & MqttEndpoints)
 * <p>
 * This programming interface lets a JavaScript client application use 
 * a {@link module:rtcomm.RtcommEndpoint|Real Time Communication Endpoint}
 * to implement WebRTC simply. When {@link module:rtcomm.EndpointProvider|instantiated} 
 * & {@link module:rtcomm.RtcommEndpointProvider#init|initialized} the
 * EndpointProvider connects to the defined MQTT Server and subscribes to a unique topic
 * that is used to receive inbound communication.
 * <p>
 * See the example in {@link module:rtcomm.EndpointProvider#init|EndpointProvider.init()}
 * <p>
 *
 * @requires {@link mqttws31.js}
